        <h2>"<em>Never</em> ever press down on your burger!"</h2>
        <p>How many times have you read that in a book or heard a TV chef say it? "It squeezes the juices out!"  
            "It turns your lunch into a hockey puck!" Sometimes they'll try and appeal to your compassionate side. 
            "Certainly there are some things that deserve crushing. Evil grapes. T-800 model Terminators. Rebel 
            scum trapped in trash disposals. But what has that poor, defenseless little burger ever done to you 
            to deserve such a fate?"</p>
        <p>You've heard it so many times you can't help but believe it's true, right?</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
                <li>16 to 20 ounces (455g to 570g) ground beef, divided into four 4-ounce portions (see note)</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>Cheese slices (if desired)</li>
                <li>Four toasted burger buns</li>
                <li>Toppings and condiments, as desired</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <h3 class="stepsHeading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add oil to a 12-inch stainless steel, carbon steel, or cast iron skillet and wipe around with a 
                paper towel. Set skillet over medium heat and allow to preheat for about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, 
                gently form each portion of ground beef into a cylindrical puck about 2 inches tall, pressing 
                together just until meat holds its shape without falling apart. Season generously on all sides with 
                salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Increase heat under skillet to high and heat until skillet is smoking. Add 2 beef pucks to 
                skillet and, using a firm, stiff metal spatula, press down on each one until they're roughly 
                4 to 4 1/2 inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. It helps to use a second spatula to apply 
                downward pressure to the first if you are having trouble smashing them hard enough.</li>
            <li>Cook without moving until a golden brown crust develops, about 1 1/2 minutes. Use the edge of 
                the spatula to carefully scrape up and flip the patties one at a time, making sure to get all 
                browned bits removed from the skillet. If using cheese, add now.</li>
            <li>Continue to cook until patties are cooked to desired donenessâ€”about 30 seconds longer for 
                medium-rare. Transfer patties to toasted buns, topping buns and/or patties as desired, close 
                burgers, and serve immediately. Wipe out skillet with paper towel and repeat process with 
                remaining ground beef pucks.</li>
        </ol>
