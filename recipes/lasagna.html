        <h2>Lasagna Napoletana <em>(Lasagna With Sausage, Smoked Cheese, and Meatballs)</em> Recipe</h2>
        <p>We all know about lasagna Bolognese, the Northern Italian casserole made with fresh 
            pasta layered with <em>cheese sauce</em> and a <em>slow-cooked meat sauce</em> enriched 
            with <em>cream</em>. But what if I told you that there was another lasagna out there every bit 
            as decadent, involved, rib-sticking, and delicious? I introduce to you <strong>Lasagna 
            Napoletana</strong>, a lasagna that comes stuffed with an <em>insanely meaty and savory red 
            sauce, small meatballs, slices of sausage, and not one, not two, not even three, but 
            <strong>four types of cheese</strong></em>.</p>

        <ul><Strong>Why this recipe works:</Strong>
            <li>A slow-cooked red sauce picks up tons of flavor from pork ribs.</li>
            <li>The ribs are ground into tender meatballs that are fried crisp before incorporating.</li>
            <li>Four types of cheese—ricotta, mozzarella, smoked mozzarella, and Parmesan—take 
                it over the top.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Any mildly flavored sausage from the butcher will do. If no mild sausages are available, 
            sweet Italian sausages will work. Use only a high quality whole-milk ricotta with no gums or 
            stabilizers, like Calabro. If unavailable, use cottage cheese pulsed in the food processor for 
            15 seconds in place of the ricotta.</p>

        <h3 class="stepsHeading">Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and preheat oven to 300°F. Season ribs with salt 
                and pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat until shimmering. 
                Add ribs and cook without moving until well browned, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip and cook until second 
                side is well browned, 5 to 7 minutes longer. Transfer to a plate and set aside.</li>
            <li>Add onions to now-empty dutch oven and cook, scraping up any browned bits, and stirring 
                frequently until just beginning to brown, about 6 minutes. Add 8 cloves garlic and continue 
                cooking until onions and garlic are lightly browned, about 3 minutes longer. Add pepper flakes 
                and oregano and cook, stirring, for 30 seconds. Add wine and cook until nearly completely reduced, 
                about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add tomatoes, Parmesan rind, and 3/4 of basil. Return ribs to pot and bring to a simmer. 
                Cover with lid slightly ajar and place in the oven. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rib 
                bones can be easily pulled from the meat, about 3 hours. Add sausages and continue cooking for 30 
                minutes. Remove pot from oven and increase oven temperature to 375°F.</li>
            <li>Transfer ribs to a bowl, discard bones, and let stand until cool enough to handle. Scrape off 
                excess sauce and return it to the pot. Roughly shred rib meat (there should be about 1 1/2 pounds) 
                and transfer to the work bowl of a food processor.</li>
            <li>Process until it forms a finely shredded paste, scraping the sides of the processor as necessary. 
                Transfer mixture to a large bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add bread, eggs, 3 ounces of Parmesan, remaining 4 cloves garlic, and parsley and process until a 
                smooth paste is formed. Transfer to bowl with meat and fold by hand until homogenous.</li>
            <li>Form mixture into 1/2-inch balls using wet hands. You should end up with about 60 meatballs.</li>
            <li>Heat vegetable oil in a 10-inch no-stick or cast iron skillet over high heat until it reaches 350°F. 
                Add as many meatballs fit in a single layer, dropping them in gently one at a time. Cook without moving 
                until well browned on first side, about 1 1/2 minutes. Carefully flip and cook until browned all over 
                (meatballs will be very delicate). Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and repeat until all the meatballs 
                are cooked.</li>
            <li>Combine ricotta with 1 1/2 cups sauce in a medium bowl. Cook lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling 
                water according to package directions. Drain on clean kitchen towels. If using no-boil noodles, soak in 
                warm water for 30 minutes to partially hydrate.</li>
            <li>Remove the sausages from the sauce and slice into thin disks. Butter the bottom and sides of a lasagna pan. 
                Spread 1/5 of red sauce on bottom of pan and top with a layer of lasagna noodles.</li>
            <li>Spread 1/3 of ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by 1/3 of meatballs, 1/3 of sliced sausage, 
                1/4 of mozzarella, and 1/4 of smoked mozzarella. Top with another 1/5 of red sauce and a generous 
                grating of Parmesan cheese.</li>
            <li>Repeat step 11 two more times. You should have used up all the noodles, meatballs, sausage, and 
                ricotta mixture. Top final layer of noodles with remaining sauce and remaining cheeses. Tear up 
                remaining basil leaves and sprinkle over the top. Drizzle with remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Cover tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove foil and continue baking until 
                browned and bubbly, about 20 minutes longer. Remove from oven, allow to rest for 10 minutes, slice, 
                and serve.</li>
